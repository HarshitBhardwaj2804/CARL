      "content": "Megatron is a fictional robot character from the **Transformers** franchise. He is best known as the ruthless leader of the **Decepticons**, the faction of alien robots that opposes the heroic **Autobots**.  \n\n**Key points about Megatron:**\n\n- **Origins:** In most continuities, Megatron was originally a worker or soldier on the planet Cybertron who rose to power through his ambition, charisma, and willingness to use force.  \n- **Role:** He seeks to dominate Cybertron and, later, Earth, believing that only a strong, authoritarian rule can bring order to the galaxy.  \n- **Personality:** Charismatic, intelligent, and brutally pragmatic. He is a master strategist and a charismatic speaker, but he often resorts to intimidation and violence.  \n- **Weaponry:** Frequently wields a powerful gun called the **Fusion Cannon** (or variations like the **Megatron Gun**). In many versions he can also transform into a weapon\u2014most commonly a gun, tank, or jet.  \n- **Transformations:**  \n  - *Original 1980s series:* Transforms into a Walther P38 pistol.  \n  - *Generation 1 toys:* Later changed to a tank.  \n  - *Modern media (e.g., Michael Bay films, *Transformers: Prime*):* Often a large, heavily armed jet or a futuristic tank.  \n- **Notable appearances:**  \n  - **Animated series:** *The Transformers* (1984), *Transformers: Prime*, *Transformers: War for Cybertron* (Netflix).  \n  - **Live\u2011action films:** Portrayed by Hugo Weaving (first three Michael Bay movies) and then by Frank Welker (voice) and later by voice actors in the spin\u2011off *Bumblebee* and *Transformers: Rise of the Beasts*.  \n  - **Comics & games:** Prominent in Marvel, IDW, and various video games like *Transformers: Fall of Cybertron* and *Warframe* (as a character inspiration).  \n\nMegatron\u2019s enduring appeal comes from his role as the archetypal villain who believes that order can only be achieved through absolute control\u2014making him a foil to Optimus Prime\u2019s more compassionate leadership style."

When a continuity does not give explicit dates, the era is approximated based on story progression.\n\n---\n\n### How the Timeline Fits Together\n\n1. **Origin \u2192 War for Cybertron** \u2013 Megatron\u2019s rise from a disgruntled worker to the Decepticon leader is the common seed across all versions.  \n2. **Defeat & Exile** \u2013 The classic \u201cMegatron is presumed dead, flees to Earth\u201d motif recurs in G1, the live\u2011action movies, and the *Prime* series.  \n3. **Rebirth as Galvatron** \u2013 Many continuities (G1, *Beast Wars*, *War for Cybertron*) use a catastrophic energy event (Unicron\u2019s power, Energon overload) to transform Megatron into the even more powerful **Galvatron**.  \n4. **Modern Media Divergence** \u2013  \n   * **G1/IDW** keep the original robot\u2011to\u2011tank\u2011to\u2011gun transformations.  \n   * **Prime** gives him a sleek jet\u2011tank hybrid and a darker, more mystical agenda (Dark Energon).  \n   * **Michael Bay** emphasizes massive, cinematic weaponry and a relentless quest for the AllSpark/Matrix.  \n5. **Recurring Themes** \u2013 Authoritarian rule, belief that \u201cstrength alone can bring order,\u201d and an unyielding rivalry with **Optimus Prime**.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Reference (Real\u2011World Publication Dates)\n\n| Year | Media | How Megatron Was Portrayed |\n|------|-------|----------------------------|\n| 1984 | *The Transformers* (G1 cartoon & Marvel comics) | Robot \u2192 Walther P38 gun |\n| 1986 | *The Transformers: The Movie* | Dying, rebuilt as **Galvatron** |\n| 1996 | *Beast Wars* (TV) | Predacon \u2192 later **Galvatron** |\n| 2007 | *Transformers* (live\u2011action) | Massive tank/jet hybrid |\n| 2010 | *Transformers: Prime* (TV) | Jet \u2192 Dark Energon seeker |\n| 2020 | *War for Cybertron: Siege* (Netflix) | Galvatron, final war leader |\n| 2023 | *Rise of the Beasts* (film) | Legacy cameo |\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Across the multiverse of Transformers, Megatron\u2019s story follows a core arc\u2014*rising from oppression, leading a brutal war, being defeated, returning stronger (often as Galvatron), and endlessly challenging Optimus Prime for control of Cybertron and Earth.* The specifics (vehicle mode, weaponry, and exact dates) shift with each reboot, but the character\u2019s ambition and ruthlessness remain constant."

Norms around consent, age of consent, and sexual orientation are shaped by these contexts.\n- **Ethical aspect** \u2013 Central to any sexual activity is consent\u2014clear, enthusiastic, and ongoing agreement from all parties involved.\n\nIf you have a more specific question\u2014whether about health, relationships, consent, or something else\u2014feel free to ask!"

To display a different Pok\u00e9mon, edit the URL:  \n   `.../pokemon/<number>.png` (e.g., `1` \u2192 Bulbasaur, `7` \u2192 Squirtle).  \n\nThe card is responsive enough for desktop and mobile, and the hover effect adds a bit of polish. Enjoy!"
